            When you're dealing with Threads, u should be aware of 3 kind of problems that can occur:
            - Starvation (when a Thread A is waiting for B, but A is taking too long)
            - Livelock (Threads from an indefinite loop, expecting confirmation of each other)
            - Deadlock (Two or more threads are blocked forever waiting for each other)
         */
